## 📜 The Protocols

### 🛰️ PROTOCOL_01: The 7-Day Sprint
The arena updates every 24 hours with new algorithmic challenges. The mission is consistency.

* **Daily Payload:** 4 Core Problems (Easy to Medium) + 1 Bonus Anomaly (Hard).
* **Topics:** Rotation includes Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, and Trees.
* **Time Window:** Problems go live at `00:00 AM` and the sector locks at `11:59 PM`.
* **Platform:** All code execution occurs in **The Arena**.

### 📈 PROTOCOL_02: Scoring & Optimization
Your rank is determined by both accuracy and computational efficiency.

* **Base Rewards:**
    * Easy: `1 pt`
    * Medium: `2-4 pts`
    * Hard (Bonus): `5 pts`
* **Optimization Bonus:** High-efficiency solutions (optimal runtime) receive a **2x Multiplier**. Brute force is discouraged.
* **Iteration:** You may resubmit solutions to optimize your runtime and claim the maximum point cap.

### ⚖️ PROTOCOL_03: The Economy (Gambling)
Points are not just for ranking; they are currency.

* **Prediction Pool:** Wager your earned points on specific problems. Solvers split the pot; those who fail to solve forfeit their wager.
* **Consistency Pool:** A high-stakes daily pool. If you miss a single day, your contribution is distributed among the survivors who maintained their streak.
* **Live Intel:** Real-time telemetry tracks the **Top 3 Operatives**, **Fastest Solvers**, and **Longest Active Sessions**.
