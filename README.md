🐝 LB Leetcothon v1.0
Code. Compete. Conquer.
Leetcothon is a high-intensity, 7-day algorithmic sprint designed exclusively for CSULB students during Spring Break. This is more than a competition—it is a community-driven arena designed to sharpen problem-solving skills and prepare participants for top-tier technical internship interviews.

📅 Event Schedule
Start: Monday, March 30 @ 00:00 AM

End: Sunday, April 5 @ 08:00 PM

Format: 100% Online | Self-Monitored | Non-Profit

🛠️ The Mission: void prepareForSuccess()
This event is a zero-cost initiative focused on hands-on implementation. We aim to bridge the gap between classroom theory and interview reality by mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in a high-pressure, collaborative environment.

📜 The Playbook (Protocols)
🛰️ PROTOCOL_01: The 7-Day Sprint
The arena updates every 24 hours with new algorithmic challenges.

Topics: Daily rotation including Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, and Trees.

Payload: 4 Core Problems (Easy to Medium) + 1 Bonus Anomaly (Hard) per day.

Window: Problems go live at 00:00 AM and the sector locks at 11:59 PM.

📈 PROTOCOL_02: Scoring & Optimization
Your rank is determined by both accuracy and efficiency.

Base Rewards: Easy (1pt), Medium (2-4pts), Hard Bonus (5pts).

Optimization Bonus: High-efficiency solutions (optimal runtime) receive a 2x Multiplier.

Iteration: You can resubmit to optimize your code and claim the maximum point cap.

⚖️ PROTOCOL_03: The Economy & Intel
Prediction Pool: Wager your earned points in the daily pool. Solvers split the pot; those who fail to solve forfeit their wager.

Consistency Pool: A high-stakes pool for daily streaks. If you miss a single day, your contribution is distributed among the survivors.

Live Intel: Monitor the leaderboard in real-time for metrics on point totals, solve speed, and total active "grind time."

🎮 Features
🚀 The Arena: An integrated coding environment built directly into the platform.

💰 Prediction Pool: A unique "gambling" mechanic to trade points for higher rankings.

📊 Live Intel: Real-time telemetry tracking the top 3 operatives and global rankings.

🔰 Beginner Friendly: Specifically tagged tracks for those new to DSA.

🛡️ Guidelines
Integrity: While collaboration is encouraged, "brute forcing" or plagiarizing solutions is against the spirit of the sprint.

Consistency: The daily window is strict. Once a day ends, that point opportunity is gone forever.

Community: Use the shared energy to stay motivated during the week-long grind.

System Status: Awaiting satellite connection... Operational on March 30.
